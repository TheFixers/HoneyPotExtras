Detailed Design - Honey Pot

HoneyPotLauncher
__init__():
    when the honey pot begins, look for the plug-ins that are setup to begin, upon the ports they are set with
shutdown():
    when the honey pot shuts down, shut down every plug-in that was begun when the honey pot started, accomodate a forced closure from the keyboard (ie: Ctrl-C)

Standard Plug-in 
__init__():
    accomodate errors in the creation process
    (future capability) send back information about the error to be handled in the loader
    begin the plug in to listen on the specified port
listen():
    initiate threads to listen upon the port that it had initiated upon, respond accordingly when contact is initiated:
        http: respond with Error 404 - Page not found
        telnet: open connection, closing connection
        ssh: prompt for username/password, respond with failure to login, close connection

        source IP address
        port attempted to contact
        method of contact attempt (http, telnet, ssh, ...)
        date/time of contact attempt
shutdown():
    accomodate errors in the shut down process
    (future capability) send back information about the error to be handled in the loader
    close out every thread that  has been initiated, close open ports

Database
used to record all information acquired from honey pot plug-ins

JSon Translator / Database accessor
__init__():
    initialize the database accessor and JSon translator to listen for promptings from the initialized port/IP address 
record(Information to record in schema):
    record information passed into method into the database
accessor(data type requested):
    create threads to listen for access requests to the database, and respond
        receive incoming JSon request
        translate to database commands
        receive information from translated commands
        translate information to JSon 
        send information back to the requestor translated back into JSon
shutdown()
    close down database accessor and JSon translator

Database Interface
    display list of access attempts, displaying the various recorded data
